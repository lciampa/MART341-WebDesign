<h1>Three Website Ideas</h1>
<hr /> 
<h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>
<p>This website would be a portfolio of my work the last two years in school.<br /> 
I would have different sections such as:  Drawings, Digital Art, Film, Sound to show the various mediums I have been working on.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Small Business Website - Beargrass Formulas</h3>
<p> This website would be for my mom's small business, Beargrass Formulas. <br />
She sells local, wild harvested and crafted lotions, salves, salts, and other plant medicine products from the Potomac Valley.<br />
I would have different sections about the products, their uses, the plant properties, prices and contact information.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Small Business Website - Zulalu Designs</h4>
<p>This website would be for my personal designs which are currently listed on my Etsy webpage.<br />
I started this site many years ago for my jewelry designs, and over time, I added some of my sticker and print designs.<br />
I do not actively promote or update the page, due to my busy schedule but I would like to have my own website seperate from Etsy one day.<br /> 
This could be a place to list earrings, stickers, and postcards in a more personalized layout.</p>
