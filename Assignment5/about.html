<h1>Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>
<p>As I inch past the two year mark of my current educational adventure, I have *started* to see the metaphorical light at the end of the tunnel.<br />
    These past two years have been packed full of valuable lessons and projects. As a non traditional student, at the end of this chapter, it is incredibly important to me to be confident in my work, and most importantly, employable!
    Although I haven't had any classes that have touched on the subject of portfolios thus far, I know it is important to start thinking about how I want to gather and share my work over these years.<br />
    This would be a website that is focused on the work I have done so far in school and it would be displayed in different sections, such as: Drawings, Digital Art, Film, Photography, Sound, etc.
    Having a professional, cohesive collection of my work would allow me to share the things that I am doing with others, whether for personal or professional purpose.<br />
    As I continue learning different subjects, I can add to the website, this way as I learn more about portfolios, all of the work I have done will be in one place.

<h3>Small Business Website - Beargrass Formulas</h3>
<p>This idea is special to me because it is something that I have wanted to help my mom with for years. She has a small business that she started after retiring from teaching after 36 years. Technology is a bit intimidating to her and the idea of offering her products online has been too overwhelming for her to consider.<br />
I think this could be a fun project for her and I to brainstorm on and for me to work on so that she can reach more people with her products. She sells her products at both the Missoula Farmer's Market and the Seeley Lake Farmer's Market, and is quite busy at both. Having an online platform where people can visit and order would be a great way to get more business, especially for those outside of Missoula.<br /> 
I am currently working on her logo as I learn Illustrator, and helping her revamp her professional image would be fun and meaningful.</p>

<h4>Small Business Website - Zulalu Designs</h4>
<p>Years ago, I was a manager at Kettlehouse Brewing Co. and had a small side business selling jewelry. I created an Etsy page during that time, but I found that I sold the majority of my work through Instagram and word of mouth. For years, making jewelry was a staple hobby/additional income for me. I love designing and creating beautiful things that people can enjoy. As a full time student, I also juggle various roles in different fields throughout the year, this has led me to putting my business on the backburner for the time being.<br />
I have considered deleting my Etsy site since I haven't updated it in years, and I pay a small percentage of each listing each month. Until I have time to nuture that project more, it seems silly to keep my Etsy active. I do sell a bit of work through the site still, but I think having a separate site that shares the work I have, but requires less financial investment and minimal work may be more beneficial at this point.   </p>
