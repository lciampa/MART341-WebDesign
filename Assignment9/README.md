## Instructions

### **Step 1: Inspiration and Collection**
This is the discovery phase. Find inspiration and gather materials that stick out to you. Look for themes, colors, words, images, textures. Set things aside that interest you and keep searching for materials. I have an ongoing envelope of random things I've found throughout time, newspaper clippings, images, maps, letters, art, tickets.

### **Step 2: Prepare Your Workspace**
Set up a clean, flat surface, and protect it with a sheet of paper or cardboard. Keep tools and supplies accessible. I like having a tray or plate to organize materials, especially when things are small.

### **Step 3: Visualize Your Idea**
Think of a theme, story, or concept for your collage. Sketch or imagine a rough layout to guide your composition.

### **Step 4: Gather, Experiment, and Arrange Materials**
Lay out materials on your canvas without gluing them. Experiment with placement to find a balanced composition.

### **Step 5: Cut or Tear Materials**
Trim materials to size with scissors or an X-Acto knife. Tear edges for a textured, organic look.

### **Step 6: Commitment**
Begin attaching materials to the canvas with glue, layering as needed. Build depth by overlapping elements.

### **Step 7: Optional Embellishments**
Incorporate decorative touches like drawing, painting, or attaching beads, feathers, or other embellishments with a stronger glue.

### **Step 8: Seal Your Artwork**
Protect your finished collage with Mod Podge, adhesive spray, clear spray paint, or another sealant.

### **Step 9: Show Off Your Work**
Attach a string on the back with tape, frame, use tacks, or magnets to display your work proudly.

- **Material Tips**: Use the appropriate materials for specific items, (for example, a bead might not stay on with a glue stick), experiment with different items.
