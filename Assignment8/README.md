Video - I will use the same image I had used previously, but since it is a live photo, I will loop it to create a video of the flowers blowing in the wind. 
(*** I am unable to get the video to play. It is a live photo, that I have looped. I am not sure if I have this entered in right, or if perhaps live photos don't work? Originally it was a .mov, but after trying to troubleshoot, I converted it to .mp4, that did not fix the issue unfortunately. Could you give me some guidance on how to fix this?)
Iframe - I will use Iframe to insert a google map with the location of the farmers market where Beargrass Formulas is sold. This will help people find Beargrass Formulas in town. I was able to insert a map that has the directions option within the map.
