I think in general I am proud of this very basic website so far. Coding feels like learning German, so being able to create something that is even in its most basic form, functional, feels good. I wasn't sure how the table was going to look but I think it turned out okay for the initial design. I had to mess around with the column sizes quite a bit to get it to look some what balanced. One thing I was really struggling with was centering the 'Home', 'Properties', and 'Contact Us' pages below Beargrass Formulas. I am still a bit confused with floating. Ideally for a more user friendly approach, I would like to have these buttons more accessible towards the top on each page. I took the photo into photoshop to adjust the size of the file and although I do think it effects the quality of the photos, it does load quicker.
