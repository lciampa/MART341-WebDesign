Of the three website ideas that I came up with for Assignment 5, I have chosen to develop the website for my mom's small business, Beargrass Formulas. This idea means the most to me as I know it will give me more confidence to create something she can use eventually. Because she harvests all of the plants used for her products from the land she lives on in the mountains, I would like to keep a natural tone that is professional and simple. At the same time, she is very playful, bright and bold in her personality and style, so I would like to play around with finding a complimentary balance. 

Color was what I ended up thinking about with Balance in this assignment. I chose the background and text colors first for their complimentary elements. I then added a picture from her property that I had edited. Playing off of those colors helped create more of a cohesive theme.
I had a basic idea of how I was going to set up the information, but I did have to make adjustments as I went. For the image, I did want to have it centered so I tried using the margin, I don't fully understand what all of this means, and I'm afraid it didnt work.
Initially I had each of the other products listed as a heading. I didn't like how that looked as the size kept decreasing, so I decided to just create a list for now. Ideally I would want to go into more detail about those products but for the initial set up, I thought this would do.
