Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?
A web browser allows us to access information through the internet. It is an application that sends, retrieves, and displays that information using HTML, CSS, and scripts. When we enter a URL into the browser, we are asking the browser to look for that website on the internet. It sends the domain name to a server to gather the IP address. Using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the server requests the web pages information (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, which allows for interaction, and other information like links, images, videos) The browser then uses this information and arranges it and displays it using those directions. 

What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages? 
If the website is the building, the DOM is the blueprint. When the browser retrieves the information from the server, the HTML sent back is broken down into a tree-like structure that contains the web page contents. It creates branches that describe how certain things will be displayed. This will include the CSS which explains how things such as layout, fonts, color are represented on the web page as well as the script, which allows the user to interact with the web page. 

HTML, XML, XHTML— what sets them apart?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a flexible markup language used to create the visual structure and layout of webpages. It displays the content on the web and can handle minor mistakes in tagging. 

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) does not display the content but is used to store and transport data. It is strict and the tags must be entered in correctly and are more sensitive. It is used to organize and share data.

XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is the middle ground between the two. XHTML is used to create webpages like HTML, but is stricter in how tags are entered, but it follows XML syntax and formatting rules. 

What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?
1.	The <!DOCTYPE> declaration.  <!DOCTYPE html>
2.	The <root> element. (<html> </html> - defines the html contents)
3.	The <head> element. (<head> </head> - includes information about the site, elements that link to other files, title, CSS, scripts.)
4.	The <body> element. (<body> </body> - contains all content to be displayed on the page.) 

What’s the purpose of the index.html page, and where should it be placed?
The web server looks for an index.html file first when a URL is entered into the web browser. This is the default homepage and the index.html file contains the essential contents to a webpage. This is always placed in the root directory for the website. There are separate directories for css, scripts, pages, images, etc. in the root directory.
