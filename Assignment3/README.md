# *WEEK 3: The Internet, README.md Files, and Markdown Elements.*

## *Challenges I had this week:*

I learned a lot this week and appreciated digging deeper into how the Internet works and how information moves around. Overall, I feel I have **a bit** more of a solid understanding of the goals and process of README.md Files and Markdown. I did hit a few roadblocks along the way. I was confused by the Assignment 3 Tasks and whether we should create a repository through GitHub or Visual Studio Code. After getting to the end of the week's material on [the class's external website,](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/webDesignFall2024//topic-02/git-add-directory/) I found myself still stuck and reached out for clarification. I ended up reading through the sections on README.md Files, Markdown Elements, and Developing with a Text Editor again to see if I missed something. As I followed the tutorials, I realized I was doing Part 2 first, so now I am doing Part 1 and hope that I am doing this correctly! 

*A few extensions did not appear on Visual Studio Code; could I find them under a different name?*

**Those extensions are:**
- base linter
- linter-htmlhint
- linter-stylelint

**A few final questions about the material:**
1. Is it necessary to download Atom? It appears to be a read-only site. 
2. Should I be doing the week's work in a different order?
3. Should we be using GitHub Copilot? 
4. *(This is about Assignment 2)* When I get on to GitHub and go to the MART341-WebDesign repository, I realize that I named that folder 'WebDesignHomework/Assignment2. Should I change this to just Assignment 2 for consistency? If so, how would I go about renaming that?

**Helpful random lesson of the week:**
- Always take a screenshot or copy and paste the response into a Word document before previewing the file!
This is the third time I am writing this file. I previewed the first file and accidentally hit the back button instead of the Edit button. Unfortunately, I learned that it will delete the file you have been working on if you do that. I rewrote it and then took a screenshot. Then... I did it again! Thankfully, I have the screenshot to copy and paste into this. Hopefully, I have learned my lesson with the *back button*, and this third time will be the charm.

![Here is my process so far.](./images/Assignment03-screenshot-github.png) 

After troubleshooting for a while, I am having a hard time getting the image to appear. 

I have it written out with an explanation point, followed by brackets with "Here is my process so far." inside. That is followed by parentheses and then: ./images/Assignment03-screenshot-github.png

*I have checked the spelling, location, and format, but I am unsure of where I am getting lost. This screenshot is in the Assignment 03 folder I created through VSC.
*Could you give me any feedback?*
